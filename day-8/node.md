- The `Display` property does two things. The first things it does determine if the box it is applied to acts as inline or block.
- The display property also determines how an element's children should behave. For example, setting the display property to display: flex makes the box a block-level box, and also converts its children to flex items. This enables the flex properties that control alignment, ordering and flow.

# Day 4

- The cascade is the algorithm for loving conflicts where multiple CSS rules apply to an HTML element. it's the reasons that the text of the button styles with the following CSS will be blue.
- This approach of declaring the same property twice works because browsers ignore values they don't understand. Unlike some other programming languages, CSS will not throw an error or break your program when it detects a line it cannot parseâ€”the value it cannot parse is invalid and therefore ignored. The browser then continues to process the rest of the CSS without breaking stuff it already understands.
- CSS targeting a class on an element will make that rule more specific, and therefore seen as more important to be applied, than CSS targeting the element alone.
- The CSS that you write isn't the only CSS applied to a page. The cascade takes into account the origin of the CSS

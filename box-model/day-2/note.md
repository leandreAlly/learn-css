# Day 1 notes

### Introduction

- A really important thing to remember when writing CSS, or working on the web as a whole, is that everything displayed by CSS is a box
- Display behavior of box changes according to the their `display` values, and by default the content will affect the size of the box
- We can control this behavior we talked about using extrinsic sizing or, we can continue to let the browser make decisions for you based on the content size, using intrinsic sizing.
- The `min-content` keywords tells the box to only be as wide as the intrinsic minimum width of its content

# Day 2 notes

- Though extrinsic sizing gives more control on the surface, intrinsic sizing provides the most flexibility, most of the time.

- When content is too big for the box it is in, we call this overflow. You can manage an element handles overflow content, using the overflow property.

- Box are madeup with `content box`, `padding box`, `border box ` and `margin box`

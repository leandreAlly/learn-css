# Day 1 notes

### Introduction

- A really important thing to remember when writing CSS, or working on the web as a whole, is that everything displayed by CSS is a box
- Display behavior of box changes according to the their `display` values, and by default the content will affect the size of the box
- We can control this behavior we talked about using extrinsic sizing or, we can continue to let the browser make decisions for you based on the content size, using intrinsic sizing.
- The `min-content` keywords tells the box to only be as wide as the intrinsic minimum width of its content
